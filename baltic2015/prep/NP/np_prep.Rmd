tTe **Natural Products** goal describes the ability to maximize the sustainable yield of _non-food_ natural products, while the **Fisheries** subgoal of Food Provision focuses on _wild-caught seafood for human consumption_. 

The same model was used for both Fisheries and Natural Products, which compares landings with Maximum Sustainable Yield. A score of 100 means the country or region is harvesting seafood to the ecosystemâ€™s production potential in an sustainable manner.

This document prepares data for both Natural Products (NP) and Fisheries (FIS). For Baltic regions, commercially fished stocks are used in these two goals, but different stocks were considered for each goal: 

- FIS stocks: Cod & Herring, mainly for human consumption 
  - cod_2224, cod_2532, her_3a22, her_2532, her_riga, her_30
- NP  stocks: Sprat, not for human consumption
  - spr_2232
