## 1. Background

### 1.1 Goal Description
We care about species biodiversity because "people value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many people."

### 1.2 Model & Data 

HELCOM provides species checklists for the Baltic that include distribution and a complete list of all species assessed with IUCN criteria. Species were assigned a _threat category_ (ranging from "extinct" to "least concern") and assigned a weight. Goal score is the average weight of all species assessed. 

### 1.3 Reference points 

Reference point is when all species are in the "least concern" category and score of 100 is achieved. The lower cut-off point when 75% of species are extinct and score is 0. 

### 1.4 Other considerations for _OHI-BHI 2.0_



## 2. Data
Two different data sources and goal calculation approaches are explored. 


**Option 1** *See preparation in Section 4*  

HELCOM provides species checklists for the Baltic that include distribution and a complete list of all species assessed with IUCN criteria.  
*Pros for using these data:*  
Much more representative set of species included for Baltic Sea biodiversity.  
*Cons for using these data:*  
Distribution is provided for most taxa groups at the basin scale - coaser resolution for calculation. Bird distribution is only by country (Germany has a couple of regions), therefore, will need additional expert information to allocate to basin or all bird species associated with a country will be allocated to all a country's BHI regions.  


**Option 2** *See preparation in Section 5*

HELCOM has spatial occurrence data layers for species and species are given an IUCN threat category.  
*Pros for using these data:*  
Data are spatially explicit, can score presence absence for each BHI region.  
*Cons for using these data:*  
These represent a very limited number of species in the Baltic (125 total) with the selection criteria being those with a spatial data layer in HELCOM. Many more species have been assessed using the IUCN criteria by HELCOM.

**Threat categories**

*Evaluated species*

- Extinct (EX)  
- Regionally Extinct (RE)  
- Extinct in the Wild (EW)  
- Critically Endangered (CR)
- Endangered (EN)  
- Vulnerable (VU)  
- Near Threatened (NT)  
- Least Concern (LC)
- Data Deficient (DD)
- Not Applicable (NA)  

*Not-evaluated species*

- Not Evaluated (NE)

### 2.1 Data sources and information for checklist data

#### 2.1.1 Data sources
[HELCOM species checklists](http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/biodiversity/red-list-of-species) (see bottom right of page for links to excel sheets) were downloaded on 14 June 2016

Joni Kaitaranta (HELCOM) emailed the complete list of species assessed using IUCN red list criteria on 14 June 2016.

#### 2.1.2 Data folder
These data are in the folder 'SPP/data_checklist_redlist'  

#### 2.1.3 Data treatment for presence/absence  
Difference taxa groups had different levels and categorization of presence/absence. This is what is included as presence for BHI from the checklist.  

- *Breeding birds* presence = 'breeding'
- *Fish* presence = 'regular reproduction' or 'regular occurence, no reproduction'  
- *Macrophyte* presence = 'X'  
- *Mammal* presence = 'X'  
- *Invert* presence = 'X'  

#### 2.1.4 Other notes  
- Breeding birds list noted species that used to be present but are extinct in a separate category - identified as 0
- Fish are all occurrences since 1800 - so could have many temporary or extinct sp, Extinction not noted, exclude those labeled temporary.  
- Macrophytes, Mammals, Inverts only have either X or blank.  
- Macrophytes spp have many synonym names, manually combined so only the main latin name has all presence/absence occurences for all synonyms.  


### 2.2 Data sources and information for HELCOM spatial data
Data extraction and prep was done by Melanie Frazer

#### 2.2.1 Data Sources
Species coverage and threat level data were obtained from the [HELCOM Biodiversity Map Service](http://maps.helcom.fi/website/Biodiversity/index.html) under 'Biodiversity' and then under 'Red List'.  

Data were download in March 2016.  

#### 2.2.2 Data extraction
Different taxa groups have different file types (grid files, polygons). Each species has a threat level assigned. Melanie Frazier from OHI-science team worked to align taxa and species to BHI regions and assign the vulnerability code.

Folders associated with these data are:  

- data  
- intermediate  
_ raw

Scripts associated with these data are:

- benthic_extract.R  
- bird_data_extract.R  
- fish_extract.R  
- macrophyte_extract.R  
- mammal_extract.R  
- taxa_combine.R  

Melanie's notes on the data extraction process are below. 

#### 2.2.3 Notes
##### 2.2.3.1 General Notes
**SPP data**
For groups on the HELCOM grid (benthos): there is a key (prep/spatial/helcom_to_rgn_bhi_sea.csv) that translates the grid cells into baltic regions. The key was created using this script: prep/spatial/HELCOM_2_baltic.R.

For groups associated to HELCOM subbasin: this key was used to translate subbasins into baltic regions: prep/baltic_rgns_to_bhi_rgns_lookup_holas.csv

**If these data are used, need to translate to subbasins with the new shapefile matches, should be very similar**

Helcom species data downloaded from here: http://maps.helcom.fi/website/Biodiversity/index.html
I added some subbasins to these data based on emails from Mar 21 email from Marc and Lena 
The data I added is incomplete.

The taxa_combine.R combines the 5 taxonomic groups: benthos, birds, fish, mammals, macrophytes into a single data frame.

To calculate the SPP score, the IUCN codes will be converted to numeric scores and then averaged within each region.

To calculate the ICO score, the species will be subset based on what is considered an iconic species and then the IUCN codes will be 
converted to numeric scores, and than averaged within each region.

##### 2.2.3.2 Benthic data

Weird thing: you can download a map for each species, but all the species are included in each file.  The
only difference is that there is a unique html downloaded from IUCN for the species in question.

These data are in the format of polygons that are functionally rasters.

The corresponding benthic dbf file is saved as csv: benthos_spatial_data.csv 

Painstakingly made a file to match the names in .shp file with the species names and vulnerability: benthic_species.csv

#####  2.1.3.3 Bird data 
There was no combined Helcom spatial file for birds (like there was for the benthic data).  

One complication was that some species had data in the format of the "raster-style" polygons.  While others were actual range polygons.

Given this, each bird spatial file was opened and then the range polygons were overlapped with the bhi regions.  

NOTE: one bird species fell out of the bhi polygon areas and was excluded. I would probably ignore....but it might be worth figuring out.

The spatial files downloaded from Helcom are located here: /var/data/ohi/git-annex/Baltic/spp/Birds

The script used to open each bird file and associate the polygons with BHI regions is: bird_data_extract.R

The extracted bird data is here: intermediate/birds.csv

##### 2.2.3.4 Mammal data
There is a combined file for mammals.  The ranges are described using polygons that relate to subbasins.

Some species have multiple IUCN categories (probably due to subspecies).
It would be ideal if we know which categories correspond to which regions, 
but these data are not available. Two possible options are:

1. average them
2. use the most conservative option

I am going with #2 for now, but this would be easy to change (code in mammal_extract.R).
   
The script used to extract the data was: mammal_extract.R
The extracted mammal data are here: intermediate/mammals.R


##### 2.2.3.5 Fish data
There is a combined file for fish.  The range data are polygons that correspond to subbasins.


##### 2.2.3.6 Macrophyte data
N=17 datapoints fell outside the water.  This could probably be corrected by extracting the CELLCODES that land inland with some buffer.  
Don't know if this is worth the effort...


## 3. Goal model
BD goal will only be based on the SPP sub-component

### 3.1 Goal status

#### 3.1.1 Checklist/redlist data goal model

Xspp_b = geometric_mean (Xspp_b,t)

Xpp_b,t = 1- (sum[wi_t,b]/R_t,b)

- *b* = basin 
- *t* = taxa group  
- *wi_t,b* = _threat weights_ for each species *i* in taxa group *t* in basin *b*  
R_t,b = Ref point = Total number of species in basin *b* for taxa group *t* (eg. score equals 1 when all species i have wi of LC)  

Scale min value = score is 0 when 75% of species are extinct.*  
*From Halpern et al 2012, SI. "We scaled the lower end of the biodiversity goal to be
0 when 75% species are extinct, a level comparable to the five documented mass extinctions"  

_wi_ values come from Halpern et al 2012, Supplemental Information: 

- EX = 1.0  
- CR = 0.8  
- EN = 0.6  
- VU = 0.4  
- NT = 0.2  
- LC = 0
- DD = not included, "We did not include the Data Deficient classification as assessed species following previously published guidelines for a mid-point approach"  


#### 3.1.2 Spatial data goal model
Xspp_r = 1- sum[wi]/R  

wi = threat weights for each species i, R = total number of species in BHI region r  
R = Ref point = Total number of species in region r  (eg. score equals 1 when all species i have wi of LC)  

Scale min value = score is 0 when 75% of species are extinct.*  
*From Halpern et al 2012, SI. "We scaled the lower end of the biodiversity goal to be
0 when 75% species are extinct, a level comparable to the five documented mass extinctions"  

wi from Halpern et al 2012, SI

- EX = 1.0  
- CR = 0.8  
- EN = 0.6  
- VU = 0.4  
- NT = 0.2  
- LC = 0
- DD = not included, "We did not include the Data Deficient classification as assessed species following previously published guidelines for a mid-point approach"  

**Will do above calculation for basin, not BHI region if use checklist distributions**


### 3.2 Goal trend
TBD  

# Two alternative data sources and status calculations follow.  Need to assess which is best.  

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "hide")

## source common libraries, directories, functions, etc
source('~/github/bhi/baltic2015/prep/common.r')
dir_spp    = file.path(dir_prep, 'SPP')

## add a README.md to the prep directory
create_readme(dir_spp, 'spp_prep.rmd')
```



## 4. Data layer preparation with checklist distribution data

### 4.1 Data organization

#### 4.1.1 Read in data

```{r read in checklist and redlist}

bbirds = read.csv(file.path(dir_spp,'data_checklist_redlist/breedingbirds_dist_checklist.csv'), sep= ";", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

fish = read.csv(file.path(dir_spp,'data_checklist_redlist/fish_dist_checklist.csv'), sep= ";", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

invert = read.csv(file.path(dir_spp,'data_checklist_redlist/invert_dist_checklist.csv'), sep= ";", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

invert_taxa_all = read.csv(file.path(dir_spp,'data_checklist_redlist/invert_dist_checklist_alltaxalevels.csv'), sep= ";", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) ## this is the same distribution data as in the "invert" object but all taxa levels are included in the csv so can be modified for insects

macrophytes = read.csv(file.path(dir_spp,'data_checklist_redlist/macrophytes_dist_checklist.csv'), sep= ";", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

mammals = read.csv(file.path(dir_spp,'data_checklist_redlist/mammals_dist_checklist.csv'), sep= ";", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


redlist = read.csv(file.path(dir_spp,'data_checklist_redlist/helcom_redlist_allspecies.csv'), sep= ";", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

#### 4.1.2 Data structure

```{r data structure}
str(bbirds)
str(fish)
str(invert) 
str(invert_taxa_all)
str(macrophytes)
str(mammals)
str(redlist)
```

#### 4.1.3 Translate code to presence/absence
Objective is to get a data layer of current species occurence.  

Each taxa group has a different code for noting distribution in different regions. Translate to a 1 or 0 for presence absence then gather to long format

##### 4.1.3.1 Breeding birds
X = breeding  
(X) = sporadic breeding (only occasional breeding records)  
0 = 	extinct (breeding in the past, but no actual breeding records)  
0	= sporadic breeder in the past, no breeding records during the last 3 generations or 10 years  
0(X) =	extinct as a regular breeder, but sporadic breeding records during the last 3 generations or 10 years  
-	= no breeding birds  

**For BHI:** *X = 1* and *all others = 0*  

```{r bbirds cleaning}
## gather birds to long format
bbirds_long = bbirds %>%
              gather(location,presence,-latin_name,-common_name)%>%
              mutate(presence = ifelse(presence == "X", 1, 0))%>% ##change X to present (1) all else absent (0)
              mutate(taxa_group = "breeding birds")

```


##### 4.1.3.2 Fish and Lamprey
R =	regular reproduction  
X	 = regular occurrrence, no reproduction  
T	= temporary occurrence  
?	= occurrance uncertain  

**For BHI:** *R or X = 1* and *T or ? = 0*  
```{r clean fish data}
## clean up fish data (had ? not removed), gather to long format
fish_long = fish %>%
            mutate(latin_name =str_replace(latin_name,"\\*",""))%>% ## remove * at end of latin name
            gather(location,presence,-latin_name,-common_name)%>%
            mutate(presence = ifelse(presence == "R", 1, 
                              ifelse(presence == "X", 1, 0)))%>%
            mutate(taxa_group = "fish")
  
```

##### 4.1.3.3 Invertebrates
X	= ocurrance  
'blank' =	no occurance  

**For BHI:** *X = 1* and *blank = 0* 

Invertebrates pose a problem that some Insecta are indentified to *Genus species* in some regions (eg Gulf of Finland) but likely not assessed by monitoring programs everywhere with such high spatial resolution.

Originally, we coded the status to use all species level data (eg. use the invert_long object below). Now the code will be updated. Insecta will only be considered at the Family level.  Because the redlist is only assessed at the species level, we will extract information for all Insecta species. The species with a the highest threat (most vulnerable species) in a family will be used as the threat level for the entire family. 

```{r clean invert}
      
## gather invert  to long format
invert_long = invert %>%
              gather(location,presence,-latin_name,-common_name)%>%
              mutate(presence = ifelse(presence == "X", 1, 0))%>% 
              mutate(taxa_group = "invert")


## clean invert taxa all
invert_taxa_all_long = invert_taxa_all %>%
                       select(-group,-kingdom,-phylum,-subgenus,-species,-subspecies)%>%
                       gather(location, presence, -class, -order,-family,-genus,-latin_name,-common_name)%>%
                       mutate(presence = ifelse(presence == "X", 1, 0))%>% 
                       mutate(taxa_group = "invert")

invert_taxa_all_long_noinsect = invert_taxa_all_long %>%
                                filter(class != "Insecta")%>%
                                select(latin_name,common_name,location,presence, taxa_group)
                        
dim(invert_taxa_all_long_noinsect);dim(invert_taxa_all_long)


invert_taxa_all_long_insect = invert_taxa_all_long %>%
                                filter(class == "Insecta")%>%
                                select(family,latin_name,common_name,location,presence, taxa_group)
```

##### 4.1.3.4 Macrophytes
1 = 	occurance
0 = no occurance
uncertain = had a note in checklist about checking the distribution  
**For BHI:** *X = 1* and *0 and uncertain = 0*  
```{r clean macrophytes}
##gather macrophytes to long format
macrophytes_long = macrophytes %>%
                    gather(location,presence,-latin_name,-common_name)%>%
                    mutate(presence = ifelse(presence == "uncertain", 0, presence),
                           presence = as.numeric(presence))%>% 
                    mutate(taxa_group = "macrophytes")

```

##### 4.1.3.5 Mammals
X	= ocurrance  
'blank' = no occurance  

**For BHI:** *X = 1* and *blank = 0* 

```{r clean mammals}

##gather mammals to long format
mammals_long = mammals %>%
               gather(location,presence,-latin_name,-common_name)%>%
               mutate(presence = ifelse(presence == "x", 1, 0))%>% 
               mutate(taxa_group = "mammals")

```

### 4.2 Data attributes

2731 total unique latin names  
Join the inverts excluding the class insecta
```{r species and taxa group checklist}

species_checklist = bind_rows(select(bbirds_long,latin_name,taxa_group),
                         select(fish_long,latin_name,taxa_group),
                         select(invert_taxa_all_long_noinsect,latin_name,taxa_group),

##add list_type
species_checklist = species_checklist%>%
                    mutate(list_type = "checklist")



```


#### 4.2.2 Get number of species by taxa group on the red list
2772 on redlist. Need to see how many are assessed. 
```{r number species redlist}
str(redlist)

ggplot(redlist, aes(x=taxa_group))+
   geom_bar(stat="count")+
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20",size=8,angle=90,hjust=.5,vjust=.5,face="plain"),axis.text.y = element_text(colour="grey20",size=6))+

redlist %>% select(latin_name)%>%distinct()%>%nrow() #2772

## add list_type column

redlist = redlist %>%
          mutate(list_type = "redlist")

```


#### 4.2.3 Get a species list that is all those present on the red list and check list
1. First join and retain all species to see if spelling causes any mismatches.  
2. Retain only species on both lists, join by taxa group and latin name.
3. Do this for Insecta separately

**What is not present**
*Not on Redlist*
343 species on checklist not on redlist.  
1. No wintering birds in the checklist.  

##### 4.2.3.1 Full species list
```{r full species list}
full_species = full_join(species_checklist,redlist, by=c("latin_name","taxa_group"))%>%

dim(full_species) #2818   6

            
```
##### 4.2.3.2 Which species are on checklist not redlist
9 species not on redlist: 

- Ringed seal latin name differs - correct in redlist to *Pusa hispida*  
- 4 breeding birds not on redlist --spelling differences, correct on redlist  
- 3 macrophytes not on redlist  (2 are spelling error, corrected)
- 1 invertebreate not on redlist  (insecta not assessed here)

**442 species on redlist not on checklist **: 
1. 63 species of wintering birds. There is no wintering birds checklist so just use breeding birds and the threat level assigned to species in breeding birds (even if a species is listed on redlist in both breeding and wintering)  
2. 9 species of fish. Not found - but perhaps smelt is simply incorrect on redlist (*Osmerus eperlanomarinus*) and should be changed to *Osmerus eperlanus* which is on the checklist?  
3. 1 macrophyte not found  
4. 369 are invertebrate species, but 367 are insecta and have not integrated insecta into the list yet. The two others were not found under genus on the species_checklist

### 4.7 Status calculation by basin
Data are on the HOLAS basin scale. Calculate biodiversity status by basin and then apply to BHI regions.  
*Note, this will mean that the data layer sent to layers and what is registered in layers.csv is very different than what is done if use the spatial data layers from HELCOM where status is directly calculated for BHI regions and this is done formally in functions.r*  

### 4.7.1 Calulate SPP status using checklist and redlist data with all species weighted equally
**Exclude birds for now**  
Do a single calculation including all species. Will compare this result to doing this calculation first for each taxa group and then taking the geometric mean (See Section 5.7.2)

         summarise(sum_wi =sum(weights))%>%
         ungroup()
dim(sum_wi)

## count the number of species in each BHI region
sum_spp = data3 %>%
          select(rgn_id, species_name)%>%
          dplyr::count(rgn_id)
dim(sum_spp)


data3%>% filter(rgn_id== 1) %>% nrow() ## check to make sure works
head(sum_spp)

spp_status = full_join(sum_wi,sum_spp, by="rgn_id") %>%
             mutate(wi_spp = sum_wi/n,
                    status = 1 - wi_spp)
               

```

#### 5.3.2 Scale lower end to zero if 75% extinct
Currently, no species labeled extinct but will set up code in case used in the future

```{r scale for 75 percent extinct}
## calculate percent extinct in each region
spp_ex = data3 %>% 
         filter(weights == 1)
spp_ex
## No species extinct
## IF spp are extinct, find % extinct out of total number of species for each region; join to the status calculation; set regions with 75% or more extinct to a score of 0

```

#### 5.3.3 Plot status
```{r plot spp status}
## Plot status
ggplot(spp_status)+
  geom_point(aes(rgn_id,round(status*100)),size=3)+
  ylim(0,100)+
  ylab("Status") + 
  xlab("BHI region")+
  ggtitle("SPP status by BHI region")

## Size points to number of species in a region
ggplot(spp_status)+
  geom_point(aes(rgn_id,round(status*100), size=n))+
  ylim(0,100)+
  ylab("Status") + 
  xlab("BHI region")+
  ggtitle("SPP status by BHI region, n= species richness")

```




### 6. Send data layer to layers
Using calculations done in Section 4 (data from Checklists and Redlist). Status is the geometric mean of the taxa group status calculations.  

#### 6.1 Write status layers
```{r write status layer to csv}
write.csv(spp_status_rgn_geo, file.path(dir_layers,'bd_spp_status_bhi2015.csv'), row.names = FALSE)

```


## 7. Data layer considerations / concerns 

### 7.1 Aquatic insects
Aquatic insects included by species which results in a very high species richnessness in the Bothnian Bay, Sea, and Gulf of Finland.  Jonne says that in some parts of the Baltic Sea insect larvae only indentified to family while others to species (we only have those identified to species in the checklist species distribtuion). **We have modified the approach so that the Class Insecta is only now identified to Family level.  The family HELCOM Redlist category is assigned by the species in that category with the highest level of concern**  


## TO DO

1. Decide how to deal with birds that have spatial dist by country (not basin)  
2. Decide if it is a problem that status is dominated by inverts with LC  
3. check to see if any invasives included in the species list  
4. How to calculate a trend?  

## Explore using Global data

```{r explore global}

rgn_id_gl <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/ohi-webapps/dev/custom/bhi/sc_studies_custom_bhi.csv')

### Global CS status and trend scores

bd_status_gl <- read_csv('https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/draft/eez2016/scores.csv'); head(bd_status_gl)

# filter BHI EEZs

bd_scores_bhi <- bd_status_gl %>% 
  filter(goal == 'BD', 
         dimension %in% c('status', 'trend')) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(gl_rgn_id = region_id) %>%
  left_join(rgn_id_gl %>%
              select(gl_rgn_id,
                     gl_rgn_name), by = 'gl_rgn_id') %>%
  filter(gl_rgn_id %in% rgn_id_gl$gl_rgn_id) %>%
  arrange(gl_rgn_name) %>%
  select(gl_rgn_name, gl_rgn_id, dimension, score)
