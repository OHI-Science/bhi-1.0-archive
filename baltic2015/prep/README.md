# README

This folder is to prepare data for the Toolbox. Files within this `prep` folder will also sync with GitHub. 

Avoid .xls and .doc files if possible, as GitHub has trouble with large files 

## Layer prep workflow 

1. copy `prep/data_prep_template.rmd` into a prep directory, rename `.rmd` and rename line 2 
2. data prep in your `.rmd`
3. knit as .html file (push 'knit HTML' button at top of the screen); this will also create a README.md with the url to view the rendered .html file. 
4. add any additional notes to the README
5. commit and push
6. view the rendered .html file using the link in the README (displayed at the bottom of the repo).
