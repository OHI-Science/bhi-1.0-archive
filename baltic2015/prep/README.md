# README

This folder is to prepare data for the Toolbox. Files within this `prep` folder will also sync with GitHub. 

Avoid .xls and .doc files if possible, as GitHub has trouble with large files 

## Workflow discussions with Jennifer, Mar 21, 2016

- use `README.md`s within each prep folder (eg prep/LIV) to identify data source, brief description of the goal model, and other considerations/2.0
