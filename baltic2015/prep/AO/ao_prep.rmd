## 1. Goal Overview

### 1.1 Components
This goal has three sub-components: *stock, access, and need*. For BHI we focus first on the *stock* sub-component and will use this as a proxy for the entire goal initially

### 1.2 Goal model
#### 1.2.1 Status  
Xao = Mean Stock Indicator Value /  Reference pt  
Stock indicators = two HELCOM core indicators assessed for good environemental status (each scored between 0 and 1 by BHI)  
Reference pt = maximum possible good environmental status (value=1)  

#### 1.2.2 Trend
**Background**  
CPUE time series are available for all stations used for the HELCOM coastal fish populations core indicators. These data were provided by Jens Olsson (FISH PRO II project). To calculate GES status, full time series were used. Therefore, only one status time point and cannot calculate trend of status over time. Instead, follow approach from Bergstr√∂m et al 2016, but only focus on the final time period for the slope (2004-2013).  

[Bergstrom et al. 2016. Long term changes in the status of coastal fish in the Baltic Sea. Estuarin, Coast and Shelf Science. 169:74-84](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771415301700http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771415301700)  

**Trend Method**
1.Select final time period of trend assessment (2004-2013)  
2. Use time series from both indicators, Key Species and Functional groups. For functional groups,include both cyprinid and piscivore time series.  
3. For each time series:  square-root transform data, z-score, fit linear regression, extract slope  
4. Within each time series group (key species, cyprinid, piscivore), take the mean slope for each group within each basin  
5. Within each basin take a mean functional group indicator slope (mean of cyprinid mean and piscivore mean)  
6. For each basin take overall mean slope - mean of key species and functional group  
7. Apply trend value for basin to all BHI regions (except in Gulf of Finland, do not apply Finnish site value to Estonia and Russian regions.)  
*Steps 1-3 done in file `AO/ao_slope_calc.r`


## 2. Data
### 2.1 Data Source
[HELCOM Core Indicator Abundance of coastal fish key functional groups](http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-coastal-fish-key-functional-groups/)  

[HELCOM Core Indicator Abundance of key coastal fish species](http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-key-coastal-fish-species)  
Good Environmental Status (GES) is assessed as either *GES* or *sub-GES* based on data times series using either a baseline or a trend approach, [see explanation](http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-key-coastal-fish-species/good-environmental-status/). There is only a single assessment for each region.  

*status qualifying comments*: for one dataset if a monitoring station receives a "sub-GES" assessment, it is given a qualifier as "low" or "high".  

Environmental status assessments provided by Jens Olsson (SLU).  See [HELCOM FISH-PRO II](http://www.helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/fish-pro/)  

CPUE data used in the GES assessment. Data provided by Jens Olsson, used in trend. Slopes from each analsysis available here, but CPUE data held internally in the BHI database.  

### 2.2 Data locations
Data are from monitoring locations (described in the HELCOM core indicators). Finnish data are fisheries data from ICES assessment regions (ICES 29-32).

### 2.3 GES status scoring
Alternative methods are explored in data prep. This method was selected
GES = 1, subGES = 0.2 *If value does not meet GES threshold but have data to assess status receive score of 0.2. This way, if regions are not assessed and use 0 for these regions, a distinction is made (NA in the OHI framework means "indicator not applicable", not "no data").*  

### 2.4 Regions with no data
Assign value of NA to these regions. Stocks were not assessed

## 3.Data layer preparation

### 3.1 Read in data
Read in status assessment, monitoring area locations, lookup table for BHI regions to HOLAS basins.  

Locations for the Finnish monitoring areas are not given by specific lat-lon because are assessment areas. I have assigned a single lat-lon for each Finnish monitoring area for plotting purposes.  
```{r read in data}
## read in data...
  ## data are in "ao_data_database" - currently csv loaded directly there, need to put in the database and then set up script to extract

#assessment of GES status, all 2 indicators
coastal_fish = readr::read_csv2(file.path(dir_ao, 'ao_data_database/ao_coastalfish_ges_status.csv'))

head(coastal_fish)
dim(coastal_fish)
str(coastal_fish)

#locations of specific monitoring stations
coastal_fish_loc = read.csv(file.path(dir_ao, 'ao_data_database/ao_coastalfish_locations.csv'),
                          sep=";") ## can't use read_csv2 because while includes sep = ";" as the default, also has the default decimal separator as a comma so does not know what to do with a period

head(coastal_fish_loc)
dim(coastal_fish_loc)
str(coastal_fish_loc)        

## Station cleaned is a column that I created to make the station names match those under "monitoring_area" in the status asssessment

### 3.2 Assign scores to GES status
Explore the consequences of different scoring schemes.  
In all cases, a score of 1 achieving highest status.  

#### 3.2.1 Alternative scoring methods exploration
**score"**: GES = 1, subGES = 0 *If value does not meet GES threshold so recieves 0"*  Only areas with an assessment receives a score. Areas (BHI regions) with no assessment have NA scores, these will not be included until the final scores is calculated

**score2**: GES = 1, subGES = 0.2 *If value does not meet GES threshold but have data to assess status receive score of 0.2.* Only areas with an assessment receives a score. Areas (BHI regions) with no assessment have NA scores, these will not be included until the final scores is calculated

**score3**: GES =1, subGES (low) = 0.2, subGES(high) = 0.5, subGES (no comment) = 0.2. *Distinguish between subGES levels that have been ranked low or high. Has only been done for cyprinids functional group.*  Only areas with an assessment receives a score. Areas (BHI regions) with no assessment have NA scores, these will not be included until the final scores is calculated

```{r assign scores}
## is status ever NA?
coastal_fish %>% filter(is.na(status)) #No

## Assign three alternative 0-1 scores
  ## score 1:  GES =1, subGES = 0
  ## score 2:  GES =1, subGES = 0.2
  ## score 3:  GES =1, subGES (low)= 0.2, subGES (high)=0.5, subGES = 0.2

coastal_fish_scores = coastal_fish %>% 
                      mutate(score1 = ifelse(status== "GES",1,0),
                             score2 = ifelse(status=="GES",1,.2),
                             score3 = ifelse(status== "GES",1,
                                      ifelse(status=="subGES" & is.na(status_comment)==TRUE,.2,      
                                      ifelse(status=="subGES" & status_comment == "Low",.2,
                                      ifelse(status=="subGES" & status_comment == "High",.5,0)))))
                                     
                                     

coastal_fish_scores


```

#### 3.2.2 Plot alternative scores by location
Three separate plots for alternative scoring methods.  

The difference between **score1** and **score2** / **score3** is that **score1** is binary between 0 and 1, while **score2** is binary between 0.2 and 1. **Score3** is only slightly different from **score 2** where for the functional groups (cyprinids) some receive a slightly higher score as "high" subGES stats.  

```{r plot alt scores}

# make coastal_fish_scores in long format then plot
temp_long = coastal_fish_scores %>% 
            select(monitoring_area,core_indicator,taxa, score1,score2,score3) %>%

### 3.3 Unique indicators per monitoring location
*Summary information from code below.*  
1. Is more than one key species monitored at a given locations?  
**NO**
2. Is more than one function group monitored?  

**Depends on location, 1 or 2 groups monitored**  
3. Are both key species and functional groups monitored at all locations?
**No**
3 monitoring areas without Functional status: *Odense Fiord, Skive Fiord og Lovns Broad, The Great Belt *

### 3.4 BHI score
1. Take mean score for each indicator type in each monitoring region.

#### 3.4.1 Plot scores at each level
*e.g. plot the monitoring stations, basins, BHI regions*  


#### 3.4.1.1 Plot monitoring area indicator mean scores
Scoring alternatives do not seem to lead to strong differences.  Clearly changing the subGES from 0 to 0.2 shifts the range of scores.  

**Note that points are "jittered" in the second plot to make visible**  

**Colors in the second plot are different monitoring locations**

#### 3.4.1.2 Plot the monitoring area mean scores on a map
Each of the alternative score methods plotted on a separate map.

```{r monitoring mean score map}

#### 3.4.1.3 Plot Basin Indicator scores
Plot the mean basin score for each indicator *(e.g. on functional score per basin and one key species score per basin).*  
*Basins are currently alphabetically ordered on x-axis, not ordered geographically.*  
```{r plot basin indicator scores}

##basin_indicator_mean

##plot monitoring area indicator mean scores
ggplot(basin_indicator_mean) + 
  geom_point(aes(Basin_HOLAS, mean_core_basin_score, color=core_indicator,shape=core_indicator), size=1.5)+

         plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm")) 



```

#### 3.4.1.4 Plot Basin mean score across indicators
The mean of the two indicator scores was taken for each basin.

```{r plot basin mean across indicators}

##basin_mean_score

##plot monitoring area indicator mean scores
ggplot(basin_mean_score) +

         plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm")) 


```



#### 3.4.1.5 Plot BHI Scores
There are no scores for Kiel Bay and Gdansk Basin, there for no scores for BHI regions 7,8,18,19. For Kiel Bay, this could be because some monitoring locations should be assigned to Kiel Bay but are not. There is no Polish data which is why there is no scoring for Gdansk Basin.  
**Outcome among score type** does not seem to change at the basin or BHI scale. Should other score methods be considered?  

```{r plot BHI scores}
## BHI Data

#### 3.4.1.6 Status review and decisions

1. Have Jens assess scoring options for GES status assessment - **Jens says alternative 2**

2. Have Jens assess method for scale up from monitoring location specific indicator status assessments to BHI region score - **Jens says generally reasonable, but GF score for Finland should not be applied to Russian and Estonian waters**  

3. Check assignment of monitoring regions / assessment basins to HOLAS basins.  
**Missing BHI scores** for Kiel Bay (should something be reassigned) and Gdansk Basin (no Polish data).  *Should we gap-fill with adjacent areas?*- **Jens say do not gap fill from adjacent areas, there is not data and populations too local to extrapolate**  


## 4. AO Status 
**Score is calculated in Section 3.4  **  

### 4.1 Final score objects
Prepare object with score by basin.  
    - **Select score2**  
    - Although scores is calculated by basin, Jens Olsson suggests not applying the score to regions where no sampling occurred. Therefore,13 regions have the score replaced with NA. *These regions are: 1,4,8,11,15,17,21,20,22,25,31,33,34*  
    - See this map of sampling locations provided by Jens Olsson for the above justification (note that the Finnish sites are not marked but covered the entire coastline as they are ICES regions. Coloration of the coastal waters is indication HELCOM coastal water type.   ![map](ao_prep_files/figure-markdown_github/CoastalFishSamplingLocations.png?raw=true)  
    - **Object exported in section 6**  
```{r final score objects}

## 5. Calculate Trend of the status

### 5.1 Read in slopes
These are the slopes for a linear model fit to each monitoring_area for each indicator time series. Data are first square root transformed and zscored. Linear models were fit for the 2004-2013 time period with a minimum of 5 years of data

```{r  slope data read in}

## 6. Export Layers for functions.r
Status and trend calculations are done in the prep folder because they are done at the basin level and then applied to BHI regions (so they cannot be calculated directly in functions.r).

Here the status and slope value obejcts will be be saved as csv files in the layers folder and registerd in layers.csv

**Score Object** Created in section 4.1
```{r  export data layers}
## Data layers for the stock component of AO

## Status Score
write.csv(bhi_score, file.path(dir_layers, 'ao_stock_status_bhi2015.csv'),row.names=FALSE)


## Slope for Trend
write.csv(bhi_slope, file.path(dir_layers, 'ao_stock_slope_bhi2015.csv'),row.names=FALSE)


```
