## 1. Background


## 2. Data
Rainbow trout production  
Date were compiled primarily by Ginnette Flores Carmenate

### 2.1 Data sources
Data from country databases or reports  
**Sweden**
[Jorbruksverket] (http://www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Jord--och-skogsbruk-fiske/Vattenbruk/Vattenbruk/)  

**Denmark**
[Danish Agrifish Agency (Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark)]( http://agrifish.dk/fisheries/fishery-statistics/aquaculture-statistics/#c32851)  

__On locations from NaturErhvervstyrelsen__  The North Sea is very rough, hence there is no sea farms located in the North Sea side of Denmark, and the data on our home page only includes farms placed in the waters you are interested in. There is a map in this [report](http://www.akvakultur.dk/akvakultur%20i%20DK.htm) showing sea farms in Denmark. It’s a bit old (2003), but area wise it haven’t changed much.

Finland
[Natural Resources Institute](http://statdb.luke.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/fi/LUKE/LUKE__06%20Kala%20ja%20riista__02%20Rakenne%20ja%20tuotanto__10%20Vesiviljely/?tablelist=true&rxid=5211d344-451e-490d-8651-adb38df626e1)  

--Data were available as total marine production by region.  Data were also available as total production per fish species.  Rainbow trout dominated the total fish production.  Ginnette converted the total production by region to rainbow trout production by region by using the country wide percent rainbow trout of the marine production in each year.  (The other minor contributions to total production were European whitefish, Trout, other species, Roe of rainbow trout, roe of european whitefish).  

**All other**
Production data for Germany were obtained from the [FAO FishStatJ](http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/software/fishstatj/en#downlApp) Global workspace, Aquaculture Production (Quantities and values) 1950-2014 (Release date: March 2016).  
Download 15 June 2016

Data were downloaded for all nine Baltic countries. The Baltic sea falls within the [aquaculture area to 'Atlantic, Northeast'](http://www.fao.org/fishery/cwp/handbook/h/en). The environment type was required to be *Brackish* to be considered Baltic Sea production.

Sustainability Coefficient 
The SMI is the average of the three subindices traditionally used in the OHI framework. Trujillo's study included 13 subindices in total but only 3 of them are relevant for assessing the sustainability of mariculture : waster water treatment, usage of fishmeal and hatchery vs wild origin of seeds. Since Rainbow trout SMI is only included for Sweden. The mean value 5.3 was rescaled between 0-1 to 0.53. This value is then applied to Denmark and Finland.

Trujillo, P., (2008). Using a mariculture sustainability index to rank countries’ performance. Pp. 28-56 In: Alder, J. and D. Pauly (eds.). 2008.  A comparative assessment of biodiversity, fisheries and aquaculture in 53 countries’ Exclusive Economic Zones.’ Fisheries Centre Research Reports. Fisheries Centre, University of British Columbia

### 2.2 Production regions and BHI assignments
BHI regions were assigned to the country production reporting regions by Ginnette visually linking the two for Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. 

Production for Germany was split equally among all German BHI regions.

#### 2.2.1 HELCOM map of coastal aquaculture
[HELCOM Map Service Baltic Sea Pressures and Human activities](http://maps.helcom.fi/website/Pressures/index.html) has a data layer showing coastal aquaculture sites (under 'Pressures','Land-based pollution', 'Coastal Aquaculture'). This appears to be outdated as Denmark say is has no marine aquaculture, Latvia has no reported brackish aquaculture to the FAO for several decades, and no German sites are shown (although minimal brackish water aquaculture is reported)



## 3. Data Layer Preparation
Data are stored in the BHI database  
`mar_prep_database_call.r` extracts data files from the database and stores data as csv files in folder mar_data_database  
__Need to make sure csv files are rewritten if database updated!!__

### 3.1 Read in data
```{r read in data}

##-------------------------##
## Read in data

lookup =  read.csv(file.path(dir_mar, 'mar_data_database/mar_data_lookuptable.csv'), sep=";")
head(lookup)

production = read.csv(file.path(dir_mar,'mar_data_database/mar_data_production.csv'))
 head(production)

fao = read.csv(file.path(dir_mar, 'mar_data_database/all_baltic_fao_cleaned.csv'), sep=";")
head(fao)

```

### 3.1 Plot the data by country's mar_region
Data from country databases (DK, FI, SE)  
This is the scale of data reported

```{r plot raw data, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(production)+geom_point(aes(year, production)) +
facet_wrap(~mar_region, scales="free_y")

```

### 3.2 FAO data
Evaluate FAO data for countries without data from country specific databases.  
1. Is there brackish production between 2005 - 2014?  
2. Is it rainbow trout or similar?  

#### 3.2.1 FAO data organization
```{r fao data organization}

## filter country and environment
fao1 = fao %>%
        filter(country != "Sweden" & country != "Finland" & country != "Denmark")%>% ## filter out countries with national data
        filter(environment == "Brackishwater") ## select only brackish water production

## restrict columns to years of interest
fao2 = fao1 %>%
       select(country:unit,X2005:X2014)

str(fao2) ## mix of integer and factor in columns ## F indicates "estimated"

## make all data columns character; gather
fao3 = fao2 %>%
       mutate(X2005 = as.character(X2005),
              X2006 = as.character(X2006),

              X2014 = as.character(X2014)) %>%
       gather(year,production,-country,-species_ASFIS,-aquaculture_area_FAO_major_fishing_area,-environment,-unit)%>%
      mutate(data_flag = ifelse(grepl("F",production),"estimated",""))%>% ##note the estimated data
      mutate(production = str_replace(production,"F","")) %>% ## remove characters from production
     mutate(production = as.numeric(production))%>% # make into number
      mutate(year =str_replace(year,"X",""),
             year= as.numeric(year))%>% ## remove x from year and make numeric
      arrange(country, year, species_ASFIS)
       

```

#### 3.2.2 Plot FAO data for countries with data 2005-2014
```{r plot fao data raw}
ggplot(fao3)+
  geom_point(aes(year,production, colour= species_ASFIS))+
  facet_wrap(~country)+
  ggtitle("FAO Brackish water production (tons) 2005-2014")


```

#### 4.2.3 Select Germany rainbow trout timeseries
```{r fao germany rainbow}
fao_de = fao3 %>%
        filter(country=="Germany" & species_ASFIS =="Rainbow trout") %>%
        mutate(country= as.character(country),
               species_ASFIS = as.character(species_ASFIS),
               aquaculture_area_FAO_major_fishing_area = as.character(aquaculture_area_FAO_major_fishing_area),
               environment = as.character(environment),
               unit = as.character(unit))
str(fao_de)

```


### 4.3 Combined country production data and FAO data for Germany
```{r combine production with fao_de }
## select only production columns (no BHI_ID columns)
production1 = production %>%
              select(country:Sust_coeff)

colnames(production1)

## rename fao_de columns
fao_de = fao_de %>%
         select(-species_ASFIS,-aquaculture_area_FAO_major_fishing_area,-environment,-data_flag)%>%
         mutate(mar_region = "FAO_Germany",
                unit = "ton",
                latin_name = "Oncorhynchus mykiss",
                common_name = "Rainbow Trout",
                ISSCAAP_FAO = 23,
                TAXOCODE_FAO = 1230100909,
                X3A_CODE_FAO = "TRR",
                country_spp_code = NA,

               ISSCAAP_FAO, TAXOCODE_FAO,X3A_CODE_FAO,country_spp_code,Sust_coeff )
str(fao_de)


### bind_rows of production and fao_de

production2 = bind_rows(production1, fao_de)


```

#### 4.3.1 Plot combined data by country
```{r plot combined data}
ggplot(production2)+
  geom_point(aes(year,production, colour=mar_region))+
  geom_line(aes(year,production, colour=mar_region))+
  facet_wrap(~country, scales="free_y")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90, 
                                    hjust=.5, vjust=.5, face = "plain"))+
  ggtitle("Rainbow Trout Production by Country")

### save for visualize
mar_countryrgn_time_data = production2 %>%
                           select(year, value = production,
                                  unit, mar_region)%>%
                           mutate(bhi_goal ="MAR",
                                  data_descrip = "Rainbow trout production by country region")

write.csv(mar_countryrgn_time_data, file.path(dir_baltic, 'visualize/mar_countryrgn_time_data.csv'),row.names = FALSE)

```


### 4.4 Use mar_lookup to allocate production among BHI regions
Allocate data equally from mar_region to all associated BHI region.  
Do not have any additional information that would allow us to make this allocation based on known production distribution.

```{r allocated data by bhi region, echo=TRUE}

## create a conversion factor for each mar_region
lookup = lookup%>%
         group_by(mar_region)%>%
         mutate(rgn_factor = round((1/n_distinct(BHI)),2))%>%
         ungroup()
lookup

## join lookup to production

prod_allot = full_join(lookup, production2, by=c("country","mar_region"))%>%
            select(mar_region,BHI, year, production, rgn_factor,common_name,ISSCAAP_FAO,Sust_coeff)%>%
            mutate(prod_allot = production*rgn_factor)%>%  #get production fraction for each BHI region
            select(-mar_region)%>%
            group_by(BHI,year,common_name,ISSCAAP_FAO, Sust_coeff)%>%
            summarise(prod_tot = sum(prod_allot,na.rm=TRUE))%>%  #get production per BHI region - more than one
            ungroup()

```

#### 4.4.1 Plot production per BHI region

```{r plot production by bhi region, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(prod_allot)+
  geom_line(aes(year, prod_tot))+
  geom_point(aes(year, prod_tot), size=0.75)+
  facet_wrap(~BHI, scales="free_y")+
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90, 
                                    hjust=.5, vjust=.5, face = "plain"))+
  ggtitle("Production (tons) by BHI region")

### save for visualize
mar_rgn_time_data = prod_allot %>%
                           select(year, value = prod_tot,
                                   rgn_id = BHI)%>%
                           mutate(bhi_goal ="MAR",
                                  unit= "ton",
                                  data_descrip = "Rainbow trout production allocated to BHI region")

write.csv(mar_rgn_time_data, file.path(dir_baltic, 'visualize/mar_rgn_time_data.csv'),row.names = FALSE)

```



### 4.5 Create objects to save to put in layers, save a csv
3 layers: mar_harvest_tonnes, mar_harvest_species,mar_sustainability_score  

Regions with no data - BHI regions not associated with Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany have no data.  This is because there is no production.  

The regions will be assigned an NA. Therefore, MAR will not contribute to the overall FP goal score. A counter argument could be made that some of these regions have the capacity for production, therefore they should receive a score of zero when having no production.

```{r output files for layers, echo=TRUE}
## mar_harvest_tonnes
mar_harvest_tonnes= prod_allot %>% select(BHI,ISSCAAP_FAO,year,prod_tot)%>%
                    dplyr::rename(rgn_id=BHI,species_code=ISSCAAP_FAO, year=year,tonnes=prod_tot)
head(mar_harvest_tonnes)
is.na(mar_harvest_tonnes$tonnes)

write.csv(mar_harvest_tonnes, 
                 file.path(dir_layers, "mar_harvest_tonnes_bhi2015.csv"),row.names=FALSE)



## mar_harvest_species
mar_harvest_species= prod_allot %>%select(ISSCAAP_FAO,common_name)%>%
                    distinct(ISSCAAP_FAO,common_name)%>%
                    mutate(common_name=as.character(common_name))%>%
                    dplyr::rename(species_code=ISSCAAP_FAO, species=common_name)

write.csv(mar_harvest_species, 
                 file.path(dir_layers, "mar_harvest_species_bhi2015.csv"),row.names=FALSE)



## mar_sustainability_score
mar_sustainability_score = prod_allot %>% select(BHI,common_name,Sust_coeff)%>%
                          mutate(common_name=as.character(common_name))%>%
                          distinct(.)%>%
                          dplyr::rename(rgn_id=BHI,species=common_name, sust_coeff=Sust_coeff)

write.csv(mar_sustainability_score,
                 file.path(dir_layers, "mar_sustainability_score_bhi2015.csv"),row.names=FALSE)

```


### Population density data

MAR code from OHI uses production/per capita  
This code creates a csv of the population density data (2005) from 25km inland buffer.  
Code in functions.r is where the decision is made whether or not to use it.
```{r population density, echo=TRUE}

bhi_pop = readr::read_csv(file.path(dir_mar,'mar_data_database/pop_density.csv'))
# head(bhi_pop)

  
## clean up and save layer
bhi_pop =bhi_pop %>%
  dplyr::select(rgn_id = BHI_ID, 
                popsum = `Total Population in 25km Buffer`)
bhi_pop

## write to layers folder to use in the function
readr::write_csv(bhi_pop, 
                 file.path(dir_layers, "mar_coastalpopn2005_inland25km_bhi2015.csv"))

```



## MAR Goal Model

Xmar =  Current_value /ref_point

- Data are allocated to BHI region by taking the production from a country production region and dividing it equally among associated BHI regions.  
- In goal calculation, data are taken as 4 year running mean
- Data unit is tons of production
- Reference point is temporal, 5 year moving window


## Calculate MAR status and trend
Calculate MAR status and trend to get feedback.  Code here is copied from functions.r

```{r status and trend}

  harvest_species = mar_harvest_species

## Plot status and trend as a figure
**Status** is a value between 0 and 100.    
**Trend** is a value between -1 and 1.  

```{r plot status, trend}

## Plot MAR status time series 
This is the time series use to calculate the trend.  
Each years status is based on a 4 year running mean of production and a reference point five years before.  

```{r plot status time series}
# Plot MAR status over time

ggplot(filter(mar_status_score, !is.na(status))) +
