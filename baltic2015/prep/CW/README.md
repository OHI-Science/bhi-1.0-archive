# Clean waters data preparation

For the global index scaling if status to reference points and scaling of trends to values -1,1 was done in the data preparation. Pressures and resiliences then works on all parts of the clean waters goal together.

### Contaminants

##### _Data prep_

For the Baltic we will use multiple contaminants (not only pesticide use as in global), so we must decide how to weigh these together.

##### _Data sources_

HELCOM primarily, also for reference points.

### Nutrients

##### _Data prep_

As for contaminants we need to weigh multiple status indicators together.
Initially we will use status data and trends from the latest eutrophication assessment.

##### _Data source_

HELCOM for **eutrophication indicators** to be used for status and **pollution load compilation** to be used as a pressure on CW and other relevant goals.
###### Status, trends and reference points
* Winter nutrient concentrations (DIN and DIP)
* Chl-a concentration
* Secchi depth
* Oxygen debt

###### Pressure
* Total nutrient load (N and P)

### Trash
See `trash/README.rmd` `trash_prep.rmd` for more details



### Pathogens

Not identified as a wide problem in the Baltic. If we find good data for this, maybe put a lesser weight on this than the other parts of this goal.
