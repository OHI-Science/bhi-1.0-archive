"the framework includes: (i) the mass of waste generated per capita annually; (ii) the percentage of waste that is plastic; and (iii) the percentage of plastic waste that is mismanaged and, therefore, has the potential to enter the ocean as marine debris (12) (data S1). By applying a range of conversion rates from mismanaged waste to marine debris, we estimated the mass of plastic waste entering the ocean from each country in 2010, used population growth data (13) to project the increase in mass to 2025, and predicted growth in the percentage of waste that is plastic."


Footnotes from .xls file column headers 
1 - Based upon 2010 Gross National Income
2 - Based upon a 50 km coastal buffer created in GIS with global population densities
3 - Bold data were taken directly from World Bank estimates
4 - Bold data were taken directly from World Bank estimates 
5 - Using a model developed for this study (see Supplemental Information)
6 - From U.S. national litter study
7 - Calculated values
8 - Economic status changed from 2005 to 2010; waste generation rate and %plastic were assigned using average values for the 2010 economic category
