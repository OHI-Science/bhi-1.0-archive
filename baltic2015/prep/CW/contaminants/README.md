## Contaminant Data Prep

### Indicators
3 indicators are proposed which would then be combined to give an overall comtanimant sub-component status.  
(1) 7 PCB concentration indicator
[HELCOM Core Indicator of Hazardous Substances Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and dioxins and furans 2013](http://www.helcom.fi/Core%20Indicators/HELCOM-CoreIndicator_Polychlorinated_biphenyls_and_dioxins_and_furans.pdf)

**Relevant text from the HELCOM core indicator report**
"The PCBs included in this core indicator report are the 7 PCB congeners that have been monitored since the beginning of the HELCOM and OSPARCOM monitoring programmes, carefully selected mainly by ICES working groups due to their relatively uncomplicated identification and quantification in gas chromatograms and as they usually contribute a very high proportion of the total PCB content in environmental samples. These are the ‘ICES 7’: CB-28, CB-52, CB-101, CB-118, CB-138, CB-153 and CB-180."

The ICES 7 PCBs are listed as mandatory contaminants that should be analysed and reported within both the OSPARCOM and the HELCOM conventions and are classed as priority POPs under the Stockholm Convention. In the proposed revised guidelines for OSPARCOM (1996) the congeners CB-105 and CB-156 are added to this list. PCBs are not included on the Water Framework Directive (WFD) priority substance lists, but they are in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD).

**Determination of GES boundary**
The CORESET expert group decided that, due to uncertainties in the target setting on the OSPAR and EU working groups, the seven PCBs should be monitored and concentrations analysed but the core indicator assesses primarily two congeners only: CB-118 (dioxin like) and 153 (non-dioxin like). Tentatively the OSPAR EACs for these two congeners are suggested to be used.



(2) TEQ value for PCBs and Dioxins
[HELCOM Core Indicator of Hazardous Substances Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and dioxins and furans](http://www.helcom.fi/Core%20Indicators/HELCOM-CoreIndicator_Polychlorinated_biphenyls_and_dioxins_and_furans.pdf)

Dioxins are included in several international agreements, of which the Stockholm Convention and the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air are among the most important for the control and reduction of sources to the environment. WHO and FAO have jointly established a maximum tolerable human intake level of dioxins via food, and within the EU there are limit values for dioxins in food and feed stuff (EC 2006). Several other EU legislations regulate dioxins, e.g. the plan for integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) and directives on waste incineration (EC, 2000, 2008). The EU has also adopted a Community Strategy for dioxins, furans and PCBs (EC 2001).

**Determination of GES boundary**
For dioxins, it was decided to use the GES boundary of 4.0 ng kg-1 ww WHO-TEQ for dioxins and 8.0 ng kg-1 ww WHO-TEQ for dioxins and dl-PCBs.

(3) PFOS indicator

### Data

## Data sources

## Data prep
Data were cleaned and harmonized by Cornelia Ludwig prior to being put into the BHI database.  
**PCBs**  
(1) Swedish data were given in lipid weight and were converted to wet weight.  Not all samples had a Extrlip (fat) percentage and therefore could not be converted.  These samples were not included in the database  
(2) Data were in different units and were standardized to mg/kg (however the values listed for the detection limit and the quantification limit were not updated to reflect the value unit change)
