1.1 Biological Integrity
------------------------

1.2 Goal-specific Regulations
-----------------------------

### 1.2.1 Background

This component of resilience captures the capacity of pressures to be offset by regulations/laws.

There are three components to goal-specific regulation resilience: *(1) existence, (2) compliance, (3) enforcement*

Three international treaties are assessed for all BHI countries for *existence* only.These agreements areÂ´:
[Convention on Biodiversity (CBD)](https://www.cbd.int)
[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)](https://www.cites.org)
[Paris Climate Agreement (COP21)](https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-d&chapter=27&lang=en)

Two Baltic Region agreements will be assessed for *existence* and *compliance* for all countries. These are: Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP); Helsinki Convention (HELCOM).

13 EU directives will be assessed for *existence* and *compliance* for BHI countries that are EU member states. These are: Water Framework Directive (WFD), Marine Spatial Planning Directive (MSPD), Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), Habitat Directive (HD), Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), National Emmissions Ceilings (NEC), Industrial Emissions Directive (IED), Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD), Bathing Water Directive (BWD), Conservation of Wild Birds (BIRDS), Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), Peristent Organic Pollutants (POP), Nitrates Directive (ND).

### 1.2.2 Scoring

By country for each level assessed for each regulation

#### 1.2.2.1 Existence

Scored as yes (1) or no (0)
Score\_Existence = Score / Max Max = 1

#### 1.2.2.2 Compliance

Fail (0), Partial (1), Full (3)
Not equal increments because Full compliance rewarded more here.

Country\_compliance\_directive = Mean (compliance score)\_all\_compliance\_components

#### 1.2.2.3 Total regulation score

Score\_Existence + Country\_compliance\_directive / (Possible\_Existence + Possible\_Compliance)

Compliance is weighted more heavily than existence when both are scored.

### 1.2.3 Goal Weighting & Mapping

Each regulation will be weighted (1 or 2) for each goal to which is it applied. Regulations are mapped to all the goals to which they directly influence/combat pressures.

### 1.2.4 Resilience Data Layer

Country-specific resilience score for each goal is assigned to each BHI region associated with that country.

Country\_resilience\_goal\_x = Sum overall all regulations for a goal\[country\_regulation\_score \* goal\_weight\]

Country\_resilience\_goal\_x - rescale between 0-1?

### 1.2.5 Goal-specific data layer preparation

#### 1.2.5.10 Overall score

Max score is 4 (1 for existence, 3 for compliance).

Directives that can only be scored on existence are evaluated on only existence a max score of 1. These directives are: IED, MSPD, CBD, CITES, COP21.

Directives that are scored on both existence and compliance are evaluated on the combined score with a mx of 4 possible. These directives are: BIRDS, BSAP, BWD, CFP, HD, HELCOM, MSFD, ND, NEC, POP, REACH, UWWTD, WFD.

In two directives scored for compliance, there was a country where compliance could not be scored. For UWWTD, no compliance report was available for Poland. For WFD, no compliance report was available for Denmark. However, these two countries are still evaluated on both existence and compliance so that their score is comparable to other countries for these directives.

TO DO
-----

1.  Weight each regulation for each goal
2.  Map each regulation to goals
3.  Prepare final data layers (scores for country applied to BHI regions)
