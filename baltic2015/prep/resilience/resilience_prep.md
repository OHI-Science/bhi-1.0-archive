1.1 Biological Integrity
------------------------

1.2 Goal-specific Regulations
-----------------------------

### 1.2.1 Background

This component of resilience captures the capacity of pressures to be offset by regulations/laws.

There are three components to goal-specific regulation resilience: *(1) existence, (2) compliance, (3) enforcement*

Three international treaties are assessed for all BHI countries for *existence* only.These agreements areÂ´:
[Convention on Biodiversity (CBD)](https://www.cbd.int)
[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)](https://www.cites.org)
[Paris Climate Agreement (COP21)](https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-d&chapter=27&lang=en)

Two Baltic Region agreements will be assessed for *existence* and *comliance* for all countries. These are: Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP); Helsinki Convention (HELCOM).

13 EU directives will be assessed for *existence* and *comliance* for BHI countries that are EU member states. These are: Water Framework Directive (WFD), Marine Spatial Planning Directive (MSPD), Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), Habitat Directive (HD), Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), National Emmissions Ceilings (NEC), Industrial Emissions Directive (IED), Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD), Bathing Water Directive (BWD), Conservation of Wild Birds (BIRDS), Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), Peristent Organic Pollutants (POP), Nitrates Directive (ND).

### 1.2.2 Scoring

By country for each level assessed for each regulation

#### 1.2.2.1 Existence

Scored as yes (1) or no (0)
Score\_Existence = Score / Max Max = 1

#### 1.2.2.2 Compliance

Fail (0), Partial (1), Full (3)
Not equal increments because Full compliance rewarded more here.

Country\_compliance\_directive = Mean (compliance score)\_all\_compliance\_components

#### 1.2.2.3 Total regulation score

Score\_Existence + Country\_compliance\_directive / (Possible\_Existence + Possible\_Compliance) - *Needs to be rescaled between 0-1?*

Compliance is weighted more heavily than existence when both are scored.

### 1.2.3 Goal Weighting

Each regulation will be weighted (1 or 2) for each goal to which is it applied.

### 1.2.4 Resilience Data Layer

Country-specific resilience score for each goal is assigned to each BHI region associated with that country.

Country\_resilience\_goal\_x = Sum overall all regulations for a goal\[country\_regulation\_score \* goal\_weight\]

Country\_resilience\_goal\_x - rescale between 0-1?

### 1.2.5 Goal-specific data layer preparation

``` r
goal_spec = rbind(eu_baltic_scores, international_scores)
```

#### 1.2.5.3 assign numeric score

``` r
goal_spec = goal_spec %>% 
            mutate(exist_numeric = ifelse(Existence == "Yes",1,0),
                   compli_numeric = ifelse(is.na(ComplianceComponentScore),NA,
                                    ifelse(ComplianceComponentScore == "Not applicable", NA,
                                    ifelse(ComplianceComponentScore == "fail",0,
                                    ifelse(ComplianceComponentScore == "partial",1,
                                    ifelse(ComplianceComponentScore == "full",3,NA))))))
```

#### 1.2.5.4 Plot numeric score

With the numeric score for Compliance Components, can not see overlapping scores for different components

``` r
ggplot(goal_spec) + 
  geom_point(aes(CountryName,exist_numeric))+
  facet_wrap(~DirectiveAbbreviation)+
  ylim(0,1)+
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90, 
                                    hjust=.5, vjust=.5, face = "plain"))+

#### 1.2.5.5 Exclude Compliance Components that have NA

If a component has NA for assessment, have to exclude. This will lead to differences in the number of components scored for different countries in the same directive. Depends on case, but could be that country did not assess or report so then review of report does not assess.

``` r
goal_spec2 = goal_spec %>%
            filter(!is.na(compli_numeric))

dim(goal_spec);dim(goal_spec2)
```

    ## [1] 818  13

    ## [1] 590  13

``` r
## count to see if the same directive has a different number of components assessed for each country
check_compli_n = goal_spec2 %>%
                 select(DirectiveAbbreviation,CountryName,compli_numeric) %>%
                 group_by(DirectiveAbbreviation,CountryName)%>% 
                 count(DirectiveAbbreviation,CountryName)

ggplot(check_compli_n) +
  geom_point(aes(CountryName,n))+
  facet_wrap(~DirectiveAbbreviation)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90, 
                                    hjust=.5, vjust=.5, face = "plain"))+
  ggtitle("Do Compliance Components differ by Country")
```

![](resilience_prep_files/figure-markdown_github/exclude%20NA%20compliance-1.png)<!-- -->

#### 1.2.5.5 Mean Compliance score

``` r
goal_spec3 = goal_spec2 %>%
            select(DirectiveAbbreviation,CountryName,exist_numeric,compli_numeric) %>%
            group_by(DirectiveAbbreviation,CountryName)%>%          
            transmute(exist_mean = mean(exist_numeric),
                      compli_mean = mean(compli_numeric))
                      
goal_compli_n = goal_spec2 %>%
            select(DirectiveAbbreviation,CountryName,compli_numeric) %>%
            filter(!is.na(compli_numeric)) %>% ## remove NAs
            group_by(DirectiveAbbreviation,CountryName)%>%  count(DirectiveAbbreviation,CountryName) ## number of compliance components assessed


goal_spec3 = goal_spec3 %>%
        left_join(., goal_compli_n, by=c("DirectiveAbbreviation", "CountryName")) ## join n_obs
```

#### 1.2.5.6 Overall score

Max score is 4 (1 for existence, 3 for compliance)

``` r
goal_spec4 = goal_spec3 %>%
              mutate(max_score = 4,
                     overall_score = (exist_mean + compli_mean)/max_score)
```

#### 1.2.5.7 Plot Overall score

``` r
ggplot(goal_spec4)+
  geom_point(aes(CountryName,overall_score))+
  facet_wrap(~DirectiveAbbreviation)+
  ylim(0,1)+
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20", size=8, angle=90, 
                                    hjust=.5, vjust=.5, face = "plain"))+
  ggtitle("Overall Score per Regulation")
