App -> 'explore', 'map'
Regions -> not its own tab; within the Overview

Assessing ocean health in British Columbia
Working with local partners over the next two years, we will adapt the Ocean Health Index to capture characteristics that make British Columbia’s coastal ecosystems unique. Our approach will incorporate locally meaningful information, priorities, and perspectives in order to track change in the health of B.C.’s ocean during the past ten years and to describe how management may have contributed to these patterns.
Why we are doing this
