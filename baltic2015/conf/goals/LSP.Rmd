### Goal Description

*Lasting Special Places focuses on those geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons, and assesses how well they are protected.
In the Baltic region, the designation and management of marine protected areas (MPAs) captures the commitment of a country to preserving areas of biological, aesthetic or ecosystem service value.  The designation of MPAs is also included in international agreements, such as the [Convention on Biodiversity's target](https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-11/) for the designation of 10% of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) to be in MPAs.* 

### Model & Data
The lasting special places model assesses the area of MPAs in each country in relation to its EEZs, and their management status. Management status are broken down to three categories and weighted on a 0-1 scale: 

- 0.1 = designated
- 0.4 = designated and partly managed  
- 1.0 = designated and managed   

Both MPA area and management status data were downloaded from [HELCOM MPA](http://mpas.helcom.fi) website.

### Reference points

*Reference point is when 10% of EEZs in a country is designated as MPAs and fully managed.*
