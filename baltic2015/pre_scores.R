# pre_calculate_scores

## This script does the pre-checks before running goal models and calculate
## dimension scores. It loads "ohicore", calls all goal functions and data
## layers in the "conf" folder, and check that all data layers are registered
## properly.

## It is sourced from calculate_scores.r as well, but you are encouraged to use this script when
## you're working on individual goal models. After you register data layers for
## a goal, or make any changes to the data layers, source this script before
## running model-specific functions in functions.R.
