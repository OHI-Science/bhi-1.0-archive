<div id="goal-description-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>The Mariculture sub-goal of the Food Provision (FP) goal describes a country’s ability to maximize the sustainable yield of farmed fish and shellfish in the ocean for human consumption. Mariculture is not a large industry in the Baltic, but it does provide some food production. <strong>For the BHI rainbow trout production was included in parts of Denmark, Sweden, Germany, and Finland</strong>, using available data. All other BHI regions are scored as NA, and thus MAR will not contribute to their overall FP goal score.</p>

<h2>Artisanal Fishing Opportunity</h2>
<div id="goal-description-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations. This goal measure whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so. It has three sub-components: stock, access, and need. A score of 100 means the country or region is meeting the needs of artisanal fishermen or communities by implementing institutional supports, providing access to near-shore water, and maintaining the health of targeted species.</p>
<p><strong>For the BHI, we focus on the <em>stock</em> sub-component and will use this as a proxy for the entire goal.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>The AO model assesses the health of fish stocks, represented by the mean of two Core Indicators for stock abundance prepared by HELCOM:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-coastal-fish-key-functional-groups/">HELCOM Core Indicator Abundance of coastal fish key functional groups</a> and</li>

<h2>Natural Products</h2>
<div id="goal-description-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>This goal measures how sustainably people harvest non-food products from the sea. From seashells and sponges to aquarium fish, natural products contribute to local economies and international trade. <strong>For the BHI sprat was included as a natural product</strong> because it often used for fish meal production or animal food.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data Overview</h3>
<p>The data used for this goal are composed of total sprat spawning biomass (SSB) and fishing mortality (F) data.

<h2>Carbon Storage</h2>
<div id="goal-description-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>The Carbon Storage goal captures the ability of the coastal habitats to remove carbon given their carbon uptake rate and health conditions. A score of 100 means all habitats that contribute to carbon removal are still intact or have been restored and they can function to their full carbon burial potential. Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems or seagrass store substantially large amount of carbon have the highest sequestration rates of any habitats on earth. They are also threatened by under-regulated coastal development but are amenable to restoration and conservation efforts. <strong>For the BHI we planned to use seagrass as an indicator for carbon storage. However, due to data limitions, the Carbon Storage goal was assigned as NA.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>We planned to use seagrass data (<em>Zostera</em> species) in the Baltic Sea.</p>

In this assessment, GDP used is for entire NUTS3, but divided among populations along a 25km buffer along the shore. 

Population data was not extracted for the entire NUTS3 area, only for the buffer area.  Therefore, the entire GDP for the NUTS3 is allocated among BHI regions, rather than only the GDP associated with the population in the buffer.

<h2>Sense of Place: Iconic Species</h2>
<div id="goal-description-8" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>Iconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through a species’ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales). Habitat-forming species are not included in this definition of iconic species, nor are species that are harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual). This sub-goal assesses how well those species are conserved.</p>
<p><strong>For the BHI, a survey identified the following iconic species:</strong></p>

<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>The Lasting Special Places sub-goal focuses on those geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons, and assesses how well they are protected. <strong>For the BHI, the designation and management of marine protected areas (MPAs) captures the commitment of a country to preserving areas of biological, aesthetic or ecosystem service value.</strong> The designation of MPAs is also included in international agreements, such as the <a href="https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-11/">Convention on Biodiversity’s target</a> for the designation of 10% of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) to be in MPAs.</p>

<h2>Clean Waters: Nutrients</h2>
<div id="goal-description-10" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>The Nutrient sub-goal of the Clean Water goal captures the degree to which local waters are affected by eutrophication. <strong>For the BHI two eutrophication indicators were included: Secchi depth and hypoxic area</strong>. Secchi depth is used as a proxy for water clarity, which reflects nutrient level in the water. Hypoxic area represents the long-term effects of human activities on nutrient levels and water quality. Both indicators are used as <a href="http://www.helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/water-clarity">core indicators</a> for eutrophication by HELCOM.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-9" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>To calculate the status of the Nutrient sub-goal the geometric mean of both the Secchi depth status and the hypoxic area status have been calculated for Bornholm Basin, Western Gotland Basin, Eastern Gotland Basin, Northern Baltic Proper and Gulf of Finland. For the other basins only the Secchi depth has been used to calculate the nutrient status.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div id="reference-points-10" class="section level3">
<h3>Reference points</h3>
<p><strong>Secchi depth reference points</strong> are set based on the results obtained in the TARGREV project (HELCOM 2013a), taking advantage of the work carried out during the EUTRO PRO project (HELCOM 2009) and national work for WFD. The final targets were set through an expert evaluation process done by the intersessional activity on development of core eutrophication indicators (HELCOM CORE EUTRO) and the targets were adopted by the HELCOM Heads of Delegations.</p>

<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>The Trash sub-goal assesses a region’s ability to manage litter to prevent them from entering the ocean to cause harm to the coastal and marine environment. Marine litter is a large global concern, impacting all marine environments of the world.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-10" class="section level3">

<p>The modelled data have been downweighted for Russia, Germany, Denmark and Sweden (proportion of coastal pop/national pop) to include only the litter that reaches the the Baltic Sea from these countries.</p>
</div>
<div id="reference-points-11" class="section level3">
<h3>Reference points</h3>
<p>The official good environmental status (reference point) from the Marine Strategy Framework Directive is “Properties and quantities of marine litter do not cause harm to the coastal and marine environment”. Currently, there is no offical quantitative reference point set. Therefore we set reference points based on modeled data from <em>Jambeck et al. 2015</em> to rescale the litter data and make them comparable across BHI regions. The upper reference point is the maximum amount of litter among all Baltic surrounding countries in 2010 - this will be used until an offical reference point is set. The lower reference point is zero litter in the Baltic Sea.</p>
