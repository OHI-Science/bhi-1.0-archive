These figures represent Baltic Health Index (BHI) scores as reported for different regions.  

Scores were calculated for 42 BHI regions and aggregated (using a weighted average) to create an overall score for the Baltic. Additionally, there are 9 EEZ aggregated regions and 17 SUBBASIN aggregated regions. 

Additional figures are within the [`BHI_regions`](https://github.com/OHI-Science/bhi/tree/draft/baltic2015/reports/figures/BHI_regions), [`EEZ`](https://github.com/OHI-Science/bhi/tree/draft/baltic2015/reports/figures/EEZ) and [`SUBBASIN`](https://github.com/OHI-Science/bhi/tree/draft/baltic2015/reports/figures/SUBBASIN) folders, respectively.
