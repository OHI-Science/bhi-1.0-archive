<h2>Artisanal Fishing Opportunity</h2>
<div id="goal-description-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations. This goal measure whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so. It has three sub-components: stock, access, and need. A score of 100 means the country or region is meeting the needs of artisanal fishermen or communities by implementing institutional supports, providing access to near-shore water, and maintaining the health of targeted species.</p>
<p><strong>For the BHI, we focus on the <em>stock</em> sub-component and will use this as a proxy for the entire goal.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>The artisanal fishing opportunity (AO) model assesses the health of fish stocks, represented by the mean of two core indicators for coastal fish stock abundance prepared by the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission - Helsinki Commission (<a href="www.helcom.fi">HELCOM</a>),</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the [HELCOM Core Indicator Abundance of coastal fish key functional groups] (<a href="http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-coastal-fish-key-functional-groups/" class="uri">http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-coastal-fish-key-functional-groups/</a>). It evaluates the abundance of selected functional groups of coastal fish in the Baltic Sea. As a rule, Good Environmental Status (GES) is achieved when the abundance of piscivores (i.e. fish that feed on other fish) is high and the abundance of cyprinids (i.e. fish that feed on e.g. benthic invertebrates) is within an acceptable range.</p></li>
<li><p>the <a href="http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-key-coastal-fish-species">HELCOM Core Indicator Abundance of key coastal fish species</a>. It has been evaluated by assessing the status of piscivores and cyprinids during the period 2009-2013. The key coastal fish core indicator evaluates the abundance of typical species of fish, such as perch and flounder, in the coastal areas of the Baltic Sea, to assess environmental status. As a rule, Good Environmental Status (GES) is achieved when the abundance is above a set site and species specific boundary. The current evaluation assesses status during the period 2009-2013.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the indicators was then scaled between 0 and 1. GES is assessed as either GES or sub-GES based on data times series using either a baseline or a trend approach, see HELCOM for explanation (<a href="http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-key-coastal-fish-species/good-environmental-status/" class="uri">http://helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/indicators/abundance-of-key-coastal-fish-species/good-environmental-status/</a>). There is only a single assessment for each region. For a dataset if a monitoring station receives a “sub-GES” assessment, it is given the status score 0.2.</p>
<p>Environmental status assessments were provided by Jens Olsson (SLU, Sweden), see also HELCOM FISH-PRO II (<a href="http://www.helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/fish-pro/" class="uri">http://www.helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/fish-pro/</a>). CPUE data used in the GES assessment. Data provided by Jens Olsson was also used in trend. Slopes from each analysis available here, but CPUE data held internally in the BHI database and not accessible here.</p>

<h2>Carbon Storage</h2>
<div id="goal-description-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>The Carbon Storage goal captures the ability of the coastal habitats to remove carbon given their carbon uptake rate and health conditions. A score of 100 means all habitats that contribute to carbon removal are still intact or have been restored and they can function to their full carbon burial potential. Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems or seagrass store substantially large amount of carbon have the highest sequestration rates of any habitats on earth. They are also threatened by under-regulated coastal development but are amenable to restoration and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>For the BHI, as data was limited we used seagrass (Zostera sp.) coverage data to assess vegetation-based carbon storage. There is high uncertainty associated with using only seagrass data. However, we aim to highlight the need to better monitor marine vegetation in order to understand the carbon storage capacity in coastal areas.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>Seagrass data (Zostera sp.) data were downloaded from the <a href="http://maps.helcom.fi/website/Biodiversity/index.html">HELCOM Map &amp; Data service</a>. Select: Biodiversity &gt;&gt; Redlisted species &gt;&gt; macrophytes &gt;&gt; LC least concern &gt;&gt; Zostera.</p>
<p>The data were classified as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 = no observations,</li>
<li>1 = present before year 1995 or in 1995,</li>
<li>2 = present after year 1995,</li>
<li>3 = present before and after year 1995.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expert opinion (Christoffer Boström) suggested that no growth of Zostera sp naturally occurs in these BHI ID regions: 12, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, and were left as NA in this analysis.</p>

<h2>Tourism &amp; Recreation</h2>
<div id="goal-description-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>Tourism in coastal areas is a major component of thriving coastal communities and a measure of how much people value ocean systems, i.e. by traveling to coastal and ocean areas. This goal is not about the revenue or livelihoods that are generated by tourism and recreation (that is captured in the livelihoods goal) but instead captures the value that people have for experiencing and enjoying coastal areas. A score of 100 means a region utilizes its full recreational potential without harming the ecosystem.</p>
<p>In the BHI, we used employment data from the EU Study on Blue Growth (see below) to assess the status of Tourism. Three sectors were included: Coastal tourism, Yachting and maris, and Cruise tourism. No sustainability measure of any of the blue sectors exist yet on the Baltic Sea scale, and thus was not included in this study.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>Data for each country were downloaded from the <a href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/maritimeforum/node/3550">EU-Study on Blue Growth</a>, Maritime Policy and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region” identified the potential for Blue Growth in each of the EU Member States (MS) of the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) and at sea basin level.</p>

The tourism model incorporates the nights of stay in accommodations and compare that to the reference point. 

We used Eurostat dataset on [nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=tour_occ_nin2&lang=en) by all NUTS regions. [tour_occ_nin2]

<p>The Livelihoods sub-goal describes livelihood quantity and quality for people living on the coast. Livelihoods includes the number of jobs in different marine related sectors. Ideally, this sub-goal would speak to the quality and quantity of marine jobs in an area. It would encompass all the marine sectors that supply jobs and wages to coastal communities, incorporating information on the sustainability of different sectors while also telling about the working conditions and job satisfaction.</p>

</div>
<div id="model-data-6" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>Data for each country were downloaded from the <a href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/maritimeforum/node/3550">“EU-Study on Blue Growth, Maritime Policy and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region”</a>, which provided 2010 sector-specific revenue data, or Gross Value Added (GVA), in the country-specific Appendix. The report also identified the potential for Blue Growth in each of the EU Member States (MS) of the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) as well as at sea-basin level.</p>
<p>The goal model compares the combined total revenue per country and the reference revenue of that country. Each country receives the same score because the reference point (see below) is a fixed percentage growth of that country’s revenue in 2010. Country-level data is then distributed to BHI regions. (Due to a lack of data, Russian regions (19, 22, 33) have NA scores.)</p>

<h2>Clean Waters: Eutrophication</h2>
<div id="goal-description-10" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>The Nutrient sub-goal of the Clean Water goal captures the degree to which local waters are affected by eutrophication. For the BHI four eutrophication indicators were included:</p>
<ul>
<li>winter (December-February) dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN)</li>
<li>dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations in the surface layer (0 - 10 m depth)</li>
<li>summer (June-September) chlorophyll a concentration in the surface layer (0 - 10 m depth)</li>
<li>summer (June-September) Secchi depth,</li>
<li>hypoxic area below the halocline.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three indicators are HELCOM core indicators (Baltic Sea Environmental Proceedings No 143). Hypoxic area is taken from Carstensen et al 2014.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-9" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>The geometric mean of the status of all five indicators have been calculated for Bornholm Basin, Western Gotland Basin, Eastern Gotland Basin, Northern Baltic Proper and Gulf of Finland. For the other basins only four indicators (without hypoxic area) have been used to calculate the eutrophication status.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean Summer Secchi depth (June-September) data from ICES database.</li>
<li>Hypoxic area data published by Carstensen et al. 2014. Deep water anoxia are defined as O2 level &lt;2 mg⋅L−1. It represents the long-term effects of human activities on nutrient levels and water quality. We used deep water anoxia only for the following basins: Bornholm Basin, Western Gotland Basin, Eastern Gotland Basin, Northern Baltic Proper and Gulf of Finland.</li>
<li>Winter (DIN), (DIP), and summer chorophyll a data have been downloaded from the Baltic Nest Institute database (DAS and NEST) with help from Miguel Rodriguez Medina.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="reference-points-10" class="section level3">
<h3>Reference points</h3>
<p><em>Secchi depth</em> reference points are set based on the results obtained in the TARGREV project (HELCOM 2013a), taking advantage of the work carried out during the EUTRO PRO project (HELCOM 2009) and national work for WFD. The final targets were set through an expert evaluation process done by the intersessional activity on development of core eutrophication indicators (HELCOM CORE EUTRO) and the targets were adopted by the HELCOM Heads of Delegations.

</div>
<div id="model-data-10" class="section level3">

</div>
<div id="reference-points-11" class="section level3">
<h3>Reference points</h3>
<p>The official good environmental status (reference point) from the Marine Strategy Framework Directive is “Properties and quantities of marine litter do not cause harm to the coastal and marine environment”. Currently, there is no offical quantitative reference point set. Therefore we set reference points based on modeled data from <em>Jambeck et al. 2015</em> to rescale the litter data and make them comparable across BHI regions. The upper reference point is the maximum amount of litter among all Baltic surrounding countries in 2010 - this will be used until an offical reference point is set. The lower reference point is zero litter in the Baltic Sea.</p>
