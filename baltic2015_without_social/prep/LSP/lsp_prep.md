1. Background
-------------

### Goal Description

The Lasting Special Places sub-goal focuses on those geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons, and assesses how well they are protected. **For the BHI, the designation and management of marine protected areas (MPAs) captures the commitment of a country to preserving areas of biological, aesthetic or ecosystem service value.** The designation of MPAs is also included in international agreements, such as the [Convention on Biodiversity's target](https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-11/) for the designation of 10% of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) to be in MPAs.

### Model & Data

The model assesses the area of MPAs in each country in relation to its EEZs, and their management status. Management status are broken down to three categories and weighted on a 0-1 scale:

-   0.1 = designated
-   0.4 = designated and partly managed
-   1.0 = designated and managed

Both MPA area and management status data were downloaded from the [HELCOM MPA](http://mpas.helcom.fi) website.

### Reference points

The target is for 10% of a country's EEZs is designated as MPAs, and are fully managed.

### Considerations for *BHI 2.0*

2. MPA data
-----------

### 2.1 Shapefiles of MPA areas

Shapefiles of current MPA areas were downloaded from [HELCOM MPAs Map Service](http://mpas.helcom.fi/apex/f?p=103:17::::::).

Downloaded 2 November 2015 last updated by HELCOM on the 27 August 2014 (according to file)

Shapefiles also provide an MPA status (e.g. designated or managed)

### 2.2 Updated MPA management status

Data were downloaded from the [MPAs tab](http://mpas.helcom.fi/apex/f?p=103:5::::::) on the HELCOM MPA website.
Downloaded on Downloaded 9 June 2016. Status updates on the website are given for 2016.
There are three categories of MPA status and each are weighed on a 0-1 scale:

-   0.1 = designated
-   0.4 = designated and partly managed
-   1.0 = designated and managed

These MPA status levels depend upon the existence of implemented management plans for the MPA areas (see 2.1.3 below for more information).

*NOTE*: MPA status is based on self-reporting. If countries differ in their definitions of "managed" or inflate their MPA status, we cannot account for those biases in the data.

### 2.3 Additional data not currently used

**Management plan status csv**

The status of the management plans associated with each MPA were downloaded from HELCOM's [MPA database](http://mpas.helcom.fi/apex/f?p=103:40::::::) under the *Management Plans* tab. Data were downloaded on 15 April 2016.

-   Key columns in this csv file are "Site name" (MPA name) and "Management Plan status"

There are three levels of management plan status that can be assigned to each MPA: *No plan*, *In development*, *Implemented*.

A challenge is that each MPA can have multiple management plans associated with it. There is no limit to the number of plans not an ability to assess their relative importance. Different management plans for the same MPA can have different levels of implementation.

3. Goal Model - Status and Trend
--------------------------------

We tried four alternatives for status and three alternatives for Trend. Status Alt. 4 and Trend Alt. 2 were used in the calculations. All alternatives are recorded below. \#\#\# 3.1 Status
Status is calculated by country and a country's status is applied to all BHI regions associated with that country. Alternative 4 was chosen as the final status model.

#### 3.1.1 Alternative 1

Xlsp\_country = sum(w\_i \* MPA area)\_m / Reference\_pt\_country

-   Numerator is the sum over all MPAs within a country's EEZ of the MPA area weighted by the management status.
-   w\_i = value between 0 -1

w\_i is based upon management status.

-   0.3 = designated
-   0.6 = designated and partly managed
-   1.0 designated and managed

Reference\_pt\_country = 10% of the area in a country's EEZ is designated as an MPA and is 100% managed = 10% area country's EEZ
 - This is based on the Convention on Biodiversity [target](https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-11/)

**Problem with this approach, if a country designates more than 10% area but does not fully managed the MPA, can still achieve a score of 100**

#### 3.1.2 Alternative 2

Similar to Alt 1 but different weights (w\_i)

Xlsp\_country = sum(w\_i \* MPA area)\_m / Reference\_pt\_country

-   Numerator is the sum over all MPAs within a country's EEZ of the MPA area weighted by the management status.
-   w\_i = value between 0 -1

w\_i are based upon management status.

-   0.1 = designated
-   0.6 = designated and partly managed
-   1.0 designated and managed

Reference\_pt\_country = 10% of the area in a country's EEZ is designated as an MPA and is 100% managed = 10% area country's EEZ

-   This is based on the Convention on Biodiversity [target](https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-11/)

**Problem with this approach, if a country designates more than 10% area but does not fully managed the MPA, can still achieve a score of 100. However, because the weight for "designated" is lower than in Alternative 1, it is more difficult to acheive a score of 100 without also having managed MPAs**

#### 3.1.3 Alternative 3

Xlsp\_country = geometric\_mean(Xlsp\_country\_mpa\_area\_score, Xlsp\_country\_mpa\_management\_score)

Xlsp\_country\_mpa\_area\_score = pmin(1,MPA\_area\_country / area\_10percent\_eez\_country))

-   MPA\_area\_country = total MPA area in each country
-   area\_10percent\_eez\_country = area that is 10% of a country's EEZ

*score cannot excede 1.0*

Xlsp\_country\_mpa\_management\_score =sum(w\_i \* MPA area)\_m / Reference\_pt\_country

w\_i is based upon management status, must be managed to count

-   0 = designated
-   0.6 = designated and partly managed
-   1.0 designated and managed

Reference\_pt\_country = 10% of the area in a country's EEZ is designated as an MPA and is 100% managed = 10% area country's EEZ
 - This is based on the Convention on Biodiversity [target](https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-11/)

#### 3.1.4 Alternative 4

The same as alternative 1 & 2, with a different weighing scheme for the management levels (w\_i):

-   0.1 = designated
-   0.4 = designated and partly managed
-   1.0 = designated and managed

### 3.2 Trend calculation

Alternative 2 was used as the final trend calculation.

##### 3.2.1 Alternative 1 - Linear trend of cumulative area

MPA dbf contains the date the MPA was established. Therefore, we can calculate the cumulative area over time that are MPAs. We can fit a cum. area ~ year. Calculate cumulative area from earliest year of MPA established (1976) but for trend use the most recent 10 year period (2004 - 2013)? It appears that countries mostly designate MPAs in chunks.

Only allow a positive slope since countries are not removing mpas? This would be automatic since regressing cumulative area on year (and have no info on areas removed). Also, if country reaches 10% goal, then the rate at which new area is added should go to zero. Then it is okay to have zero slope because the status will not decline in future - the required area has been allocated and status can only improve if all areas are managed. Then score of 100 is achieved.

Cum\_area\_y = sum of all MPA areas established from year 1 to year y

Cum\_area\_y = m\*year\_y + b; m = slope

Trend = Future\_year \* m ; future\_year = 5

##### 3.2.3 Alternative 2 - Linear trend of status scores

Following the general definition of OHI trend (ie. percent change of status scores over the next five years), we calculated a linear trend of the status of the past five years and multiplied that by 5.

status\_scores = m \* year\_y + b; m = slope

Trend = Future\_year \* m; Future\_ear = 5

##### 3.2.4 Alternative 3 - Difference between old and updated management status

MPA status data file from 06 June 2016 contains more recent management status data than that from the MPA dbf file. The difference between management status weight between these two files can be used to represent trend.

-   if mgmt\_csv &gt; mgmt\_shape, trend = 0.2
-   if mgmt\_csv = mgmt\_shape, trend = 0
-   if mgmt\_csv &lt; mgmt\_shape, trend = -0.2

mgmt\_csv: MPA status from data file; mgmt\_shape: MPA status from dbf file

The logic here is straightforward, however, the criteria for management status in those two data sets were unclear. It would be hard to justify using two data sets that don't have the same grading criteria.

4. MPA data prep
----------------

### 4.1 Set-up directories

### 4.2 Read in MPA and BHI regions shapefiles

Also, get them in the same coordinate reference system for the Baltic.

The MPA file is in the [LAEA coordinate reference system](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/etrs89-etrs-laea/).

    ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
    ## Source: "/home/shares/ohi/git-annex/Baltic/BHI_MCG_shapefile", layer: "BHI_MCG_11052016"
    ## with 42 features
    ## It has 6 fields

    ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
    ## Source: "/home/shares/ohi/git-annex/Baltic/bhi_MPA", layer: "HELCOM_MPAs"
    ## with 163 features
    ## It has 14 fields

### 4.3 Intersect BHI and HELCOM\_MPA polygons

MPA regions were divided by with BHI region shape file, and thus we were able to calculate the total MPA area within each BHI region. MPA area per region is saved in the prep folder (`mpa_area_per_rgn.csv`).

The .csv file includes information: Area per MPA, Date established, MPA status, total MPA area per region.

### 4.4 MPA management status

Joining information from the .csv file (see Section 2.1.2) to the shapefile data.

While combining MPA management data with MPA area data from the shapefile, 7 MPAs from the shapefile did not have a match from the management dataset. For those MPAs, status from the shapefile, which were not as detailed and updated as the status data, were used:

*The last two MPAs in Germany were assigned the weight of 0.6, the same as "Designated and Partially Managed".*

5 Status Calculation
--------------------

### 5.1 Status Calculation Alternative 1

There are three types of management status (and their corresponding weight):

-   Designated (0.3)
-   Designated and Partially Managed (0.6)
-   Designated and Managed (1)

``` r
mgmt_weight = data.frame( mgmt_status = c("Designated", 
                                          "Designated_and_partly_managed", 
                                          "Designated_and_managed", 
                                          "Managed"),
                          weight = c(0.3, 0.6, 1, 1) )

mpa_mgmt_with_wt = full_join(mgmt_weight, mpa_mgmt, 
                            by = 'mgmt_status') 
```

``` r
### calculating the reference point: 10% total eez per country

eez_data = mpa_mgmt_with_wt %>%
                 dplyr::select(BSPA_ID, BHI_ID, country, eez_area_km2) %>%
                 filter(!duplicated(BSPA_ID)) %>% #remove duplicated rows of the same MPA
                 filter(!duplicated(BHI_ID)) %>%
                 group_by(country) %>%
                 summarize(total_eez_km2 = sum(eez_area_km2)) %>%
                 ungroup() %>%
                 mutate(ref_eez_km2 = 0.1*total_eez_km2) %>%
                 dplyr::select( -total_eez_km2)
  

### calculating cumulative mpa_area*weight, per country per year:
### cumulative_sum (weight * mpa_area_km2)

cum_mpa_area_wt = mpa_mgmt_with_wt %>%
                 dplyr::select(BSPA_ID, BHI_ID, weight, country, mpa_area_km2, year = date_est) %>%
                 filter(!is.na(year), 
                        !duplicated(BSPA_ID)) %>% # the same MPA could exist in different BHI_IDs 
                 group_by(country, year) %>%
                 dplyr::summarize(sum_mpa_wt = sum(mpa_area_km2*weight)) %>%
                 arrange(year) %>%
                 mutate(cum_mpa_wt = cumsum(sum_mpa_wt)) %>%
                 ungroup()

### caculating status per country per year: 
### cumulative_sum (weight * mpa_area_km2) / ref_point

status_per_year_by_country = full_join(cum_mpa_area_wt, eez_data, by = 'country') %>% 
  group_by(country, year) %>%
  summarize(status = round(max( -1, min(1, cum_mpa_wt/ref_eez_km2)) * 100, 1)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(country, year)

# status by BHI_ID to be uploaded to layers folder
status_by_country = status_per_year_by_country %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%
  dplyr::select( -year) 

r.status = mpa_mgmt_with_wt %>%
           filter(!duplicated(BHI_ID)) %>%
           dplyr::select(rgn_id = BHI_ID, 
                  country) %>%
           full_join(status_by_country, 
                     by = 'country') %>% 
           dplyr::select(rgn_id, 
                         score = status) %>%
           mutate(dimension = 'status') 
```

#### 5.1.2 Plot Status Calculation Alternative 1

The following graphs show LSP status by country and by BHI ID, as well as the distribution of MPAs by country and management levels.

``` r
## plot number of MPAs per country by mgmt levels 

mgmt_weight_alt = data.frame( mgmt_status = c("Designated", "Designated_and_partly_managed", "Designated_and_managed"),

#### 5.1.5 Plot total MPA area vs. 10% of the EEZ

Status was calculated as described in Section 3.1.1. In the plot below, the red line represents where total MPA area equals that of the reference point (ie. 10% EEZ). Any point above that line means that the country has exceeded the reference point of designated MPA area and therefore will have a status score of 100, and any point below the line will have a score lower than 100.

``` r
mpa_vs_eez = mpa_mgmt_with_wt %>%
  dplyr::select(BSPA_ID, country, mpa_area_km2, year = date_est) %>%
  filter(!is.na(year), 
         !duplicated(BSPA_ID)) %>%  # the same MPA could exist in different BHI_IDs 
  group_by(country, year)  %>%
  summarize(total_mpa_per_year = sum(mpa_area_km2)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(total_mpa = cumsum(total_mpa_per_year)) %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%
  full_join(dplyr::select(eez_data, country, ref_eez_km2), 
            by = 'country') %>%

 labs(title = 'Total MPA vs. Reference EEZ area by country',
      x = '10% EEZ (km2)', 
      y = 'Total MPA (km2)')

print( mpa_vs_eez_plot)
```

#### 5.1.6 Plot the area of MPA by management level vs. 10% EEZ

Even when a country has many MPAs that are just designated but not managed, it can still achieve a score of 100, is it because the area of MPAs that are "managed" (ie. higher weight) is relatively larger compared to that of the "designated"" (ie. lower weight), and thus have a higher \_weight\*area\_ score?

The plot below compares the total MPA area of each management level with the reference point (10% EEZ). The black dots represent 10% EEZ.

``` r
area_vs_mgmt_lvl = mpa_mgmt_with_wt %>%
  dplyr::select(BSPA_ID, country, mpa_area_km2, date_est, mgmt_status) %>%

6. Trend calculation
--------------------

### 6.1 Alternative 1: Linear trend of cumulative MPA area

Linear model was used on total MPA area of 2004-2013. Area data was obtained from MPA dbf. Since countries started with 0 km2, or a small area of MPA in 2004, by 2013 all countries have reached 100% or higher increase in MPA areas (ie. trend score = 1).

``` r
area_trend_data = mpa_mgmt %>%
  dplyr::select(name = name_shape, BSPA_ID, BHI_ID, country, date_est, mpa_area_km2) %>%
  filter(!date_est == 'NA') %>% # remove one Russian MPA that has no date of establishment
  filter(!duplicated(BSPA_ID)) %>% # remove duplicated rows of the same MPA area data
  mutate(year = ifelse(date_est <2004, 2004, date_est)) %>% # select the most recent 10 years of data (2004 - 2013). any year prior to 2004 is treated as 2004. 
  group_by(country, year) %>%
  summarize(area_total = sum(mpa_area_km2)) %>%
  mutate(area_cumulative = cumsum(area_total)) %>%
  ungroup()

trend_data_1 = area_trend_data %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  tidyr::complete(year = full_seq(year, 1), nesting(country)) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  fill(area_cumulative) %>%
  mutate(area_cumulative = ifelse(is.na(area_cumulative), 0, area_cumulative))

r.trend.1 = trend_data_1 %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(!length(year) == 1) %>%
  do(dlm = lm(area_cumulative ~ year, data = .)) %>%
  mutate(score = pmax(-1, pmin(1, coef(dlm)[['year']]))) %>% 
  ungroup %>%
  dplyr::select(country, score); #head(r.trend.1)

### plot r.trend.1
trend_1_plot <- ggplot(r.trend.1, aes(x = country, y = score)) +
 geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1)) + 
 labs(title = 'Trend score by country based on mpa area',
      x = 'Country', 
      y = 'Trend score')

print(trend_1_plot)
```

![](lsp_prep_files/figure-markdown_github/trend%20alt%201-1.png)

### 6.2 Alternative 2: Linear trend of status scores

Linear trend was drawn on the status scores of the past five years.

``` r
trend_data_2 = status_per_year_by_country_4 %>% # chose status alt. 4 
  filter(!is.na(year)) %>% # one russian MPA didn't have info on established year
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%

  group_by(country) %>%
  fill(status) %>%
  mutate(status = ifelse(is.na(status), 0, status)) %>%
  ungroup()

r.trend.2 = trend_data_2 %>%
  filter(year > (max(year) - 5)) %>% # most recent 5 years of data (2009- 2013)
  group_by(country) %>%
  do(dlm = lm(status ~ year, data = .)) %>%
  mutate(score = round(pmax(-1, pmin(1, coef(dlm)[['year']]*5/100)), 1)) %>%
  dplyr::select(country, score) 

r.trend_by_bhi = dplyr::select(mpa_mgmt, BHI_ID, country) %>% 
  filter(!duplicated(BHI_ID)) %>% 
  full_join(r.trend.2,
            by = "country") %>% 
  dplyr::select(rgn_id = BHI_ID, 
                score)
  
write_csv(r.trend_by_bhi, file.path(dir_layers, 'lsp_trend_bhi2015.csv'))

### plot r.status.2
trend_2_plot <- ggplot(r.trend.2, aes(x = country, y = score)) +
 geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1)) +

```

### 6.3 Alternative 3: Difference between management status

The weight of management status from the shape file (mgmt\_shape; older) and that from the status data file (mgmt\_csv, newer) were compared, and the relative difference of the two was used to represent change:

``` r
mgmt_wt_csv = data.frame( status_csv = c("Designated", "Designated_and_partly_managed", "Designated_and_managed"),
                          weight_csv = c(0.3, 0.6, 1) )

mgmt_wt_shape = data.frame( status_shape = c("Designated", "Managed"), 
                            weight_shape = c(0.3, 1))
                              
trend_data_3 = mpa_mgmt %>%
  dplyr::select(BSPA_ID, status_csv, status_shape, BHI_ID, country) %>%
  full_join(mgmt_wt_csv) %>%
  full_join(mgmt_wt_shape) %>% 
  mutate(weight_csv = ifelse(is.na(weight_csv), weight_shape, weight_csv), 
         wt_combined = 0, 
         wt_combined = ifelse(weight_csv > weight_shape, 0.2, wt_combined),
         wt_combined = ifelse(weight_csv < weight_shape, -0.2, wt_combined)) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(!duplicated(BSPA_ID)) %>%
  summarize(score = round(mean(wt_combined), 1)) %>%

```
