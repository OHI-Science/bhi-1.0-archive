### Goal Description

The Contaminant sub-goal of the Clean Water goal captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by contaminants. This sub-goal scores highest when the contamination level is below a threshold, which is defined by the Marine Framework Directive. For the BHI three contaminants indicators are proposed, describing different aspects of toxicity: dioxin and dioxin like compounds, polychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PCBs) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS).

**NOTE: Experts are discussing whether to exclude or modify this goal as it is difficult to represent with the available indicators. Currently in the BHI assessment, Contaminants scores are set to NA.**

### Model & Data

All contaminant data were downloaded from the open-accessible ICES database (see below).

- [PCB data from ICES database](http://dome.ices.dk/views/ContaminantsBiota.aspx)  
- [Dioxins from ICES database](http://dome.ices.dk/views/ContaminantsBiota.aspx)  
- [PFOS data from ICES DOME database](http://dome.ices.dk/views/ContaminantsBiota.aspx).  

### Reference points

**ICES-6 PCB**: The target for non-dioxin contaminents like PCBs is set at the threshold of 75 μg/kg ww (wet weight) fish muscle, which is the [EU threshold for fish muscle. See Section 5 Annex, 5.3](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:320:0018:0023:EN:PDF). This threshold was also agreed upon as GES indicator at the most recent meeting of the [Working Group on the State of the Environment and Nature Conservation](http://helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/groups/state-and-conservation) April 11-15, 2016. 

**TEQ value for PCBs and Dioxins**: The target for dioxin and dioxin-like compounds is set at 0.0065 TEQ ug /kg ww fish, crustaceans or molluscs (source of target: EQS biota human health). Secondary GES boundary: CB-118 24 μg/kg lw fish liver or muscle (source: EAC). This threshold was agreed upon as GES indicator at the most recent meeting of the [Working Group on the State of the Environment and Nature Conservation](http://helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/groups/state-and-conservation) April 11-15, 2016. This is consistent with the [EU human health thresholds for dioxin and dioxin-like compounds - 6.5 pg/g](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:320:0018:0023:EN:PDF); TEQ values from the [World Health Organization 2005](http://www.who.int/ipcs/assessment/tef_values.pdf)  

**PFOS indicator**: The target for PFOS indicators was set from the GES boundary: "9.1 μg/kg wet weight (or 9.1 ng/g ww) with the protection goal of human health"" according to [HELCOM PFOS core indicator document, p.3](http://www.helcom.fi/Core%20Indicators/PFOS_HELCOM%20core%20indicator%202016_web%20version.pdf).
